We assume the values are 1 digits. If the depth is larger than 9, it will become a problem.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
In main line 67:

"newHuffman.decodePassword(encodedValPassword,encodedBinaryPassword);"

is called. However, in huffman.cpp

void Huffman::decodePassword(string encodedBinaryPassword, string encodedValPassword)

is used and order of arguments are different. So, I just changed the order in huffman.cpp as follows:

void Huffman::decodePassword(string encodedValPassword, string encodedBinaryPassword)
